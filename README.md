## SQL Blog

##Prereqs
- SQL
- Sinatra
- Ruby

## Requirements
We are going to create a Blog using Sinatra and SQL. This Blog will have a set of Posts.

### Step 1, Create a Database named blog
# check! - Use the psql command line utility for this. 


### Step 2, Create a Posts table with the following columns:
# *Create the SQL in the setup_ddl.sql file, and load this file into the DB using psql.*

- id *(primary key)*
- subject *(Subject text of this Post)*
- contents *(Post)*
- created_at *(time when this Post was created)*

### Step 3, Populate the Database with Posts
*Create the SQL in the setup_dml.sql file, and load this file into the DB using psql.*

- **Note: This SQL is created in the setup_dml.sql file!!**

### Step 4, Create a Sinatra app that will:
- Use the [pg gem](https://bitbucket.org/ged/ruby-pg/wiki/Home) to connect to the blog database.
- Use the pg gem to execute the SQL that will read the posts from the database.
- Show all the posts in the database, which link to their individual posts.
- Show individual posts

#### Extra Special Bonus (if this was easy, you should do these):
- Use Sinatra to create, update and delete posts. You'll need to use HTML forms and POST requests. Updating and deleting will be harder than creating. 
- Create a setup_ddl.rb and setup_dml.rb that will use the Ruby and pg gem to populate the database.
