Dan totally gets the importance of being interested and views programming as both an art that sparks and a tool that slakes one’s curiosity. He makes a very compelling argument that having a passion and some familiarity with programming to probe that passion is becoming increasingly relevant for everyone while having only one or the other is — in some sense — nonsense in today’s world.

A gem of a resource for non-programmers and newer programmers alike to quickly learn to use code to explore what moves them most. Seriously, check it out.');

For a long time I’ve felt like the only thing worth working on is the next most important thing. Why spend time working on something that’s less important if there’s something more important that needs work?

I’ve changed my mind on this. I think it’s always good to be working on two things: The next most important thing, and the next most interesting thing.');

I’m not exactly sure how I feel about Rust’s use of the semicolon, but I agree with Armin that I love languages that take a strong stance on them.

Despite Kurt Vonnegut’s distaste for “transvestite hermaphrodites" in creative writing, I’d like to think he’d approve of their use in Rust.');

This is a really ambitious project and it has a long, hard road to travel to achieve its stated end, but I’m all for dethroning Javascript as the premier scripting language for the web.

It’s not that Javascript isn’t good enough — kick-ass JS libraries, frameworks, and applications abound — but there certainly seem to be languages that are better-suited for client-side web programming in the long run.

Given the choice, I’d pick Python over Javascript any day. And I imagine I’m far from alone.');
